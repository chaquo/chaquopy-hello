# Chaquopy Hello World app

**This project is archived**, as we no longer recommend writing user interface code this way.
Instead, do one of the following:
* Write your UI in Python using [BeeWare](https://docs.beeware.org/en/latest/), whose
  Android support is based on Chaquopy; or
* Write your UI code in Kotlin or Java using the standard Android APIs, and use Chaquopy
  to call into Python for back-end functions.
