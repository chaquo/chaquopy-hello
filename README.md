# Chaquopy Hello World app

This is the Android Studio "Empty Activity" app template, ported to Python using
[Chaquopy](https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/). To see exactly how this was done, look at [this
commit](https://github.com/chaquo/chaquopy-hello/commit/d4e03bac7501cb838af6683d0c53ba17c415736e).

**This example is deprecated** as we no longer recommend writing user interface code in Python.
Instead, keep your UI code in Kotlin or Java for the best IDE support, and use Chaquopy to call
into Python for back-end functions.

For other Chaquopy examples, see [this
page](https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/doc/current/examples.html).
